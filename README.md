# recentservers.xml-decrypter
# By rhein7

This little Python script takes HOSTS, USERS and PASSWORDS from a recentservers.xml file and puts them sorted into a list.
Set the file via -f / --file

Executed with the argument -v / --verify it tries to login to each host and gives feedback if a server is up and if the password is right!

You are able to find these recentservers.xml File Zilla files by GoogleHacking: "FileZilla" inurl:"recentservers.xml" -git
